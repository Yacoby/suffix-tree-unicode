Suffix Tree
------------

This is a minimal update to of a [suffix tree library](http://researchonsearch.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/suffix-tree-implementation-with-unicode.html) to support arbitrary length Unicode strings. That library is itself an update of [this ASCII only suffix tree library](http://www.daimi.au.dk/~mailund/suffix_tree.html) so that it supports Unicode.

I made the minimal set of changes to make this library work for my use case, so I make no guarantee of quality or functionality.
